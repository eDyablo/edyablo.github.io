        I love writing code, and I love doing it not only for myself.
        It doesn't matter how big a task is.
        Despite its size or complexity, I do it with full dedication using the best techniques I mastered over my career.
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        I started my software engineering journey from C and C++.
        I felt in love with C++ and was swallowing all related books I was able to get those days.
        My first C program was written in a piece of paper and when I got to a computer it didn't compile because it wasn't written in ANSI standard.
        But I moved forward...
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        These days I still love C++ and know how to use it properly.
        But I'm also good at C#, Java, Groovy, Kotlin, Python, Go.
        I know a bit of Rust and I'm interested in its deterministic resource management approach.
        I can write good stuff using JavaScript, Lua, Perl, Shell, or PowerShell scripting languages.
        Also, I don't get attached to a specific paradigm and can use Object Oriented or Functional Programming or even mixed which I think strengthens the structure of a system maximizing its flexibility, maintainability, testability, and robustness.
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        Apart from experience in programming languages, I have years of experience with different application architectures, starting from small tools with a command-line interface or desktop GUI, including fancy mobile or Web apps, up to a complex multi-component cloud-based distributed applications.
        The applications were developed for a wide range of industries such as civil engineering, application development its quality and life cycle management, communication, education, finance, game development.
        The systems I've developed run on PCs controlled by Windows, Linux, macOS, mobile devices running Android or iOS, game consoles, and mainframes.
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        During my career, I've experienced a range of software development processes, some of them are more classic and a bit chaotic, some of them were almost agile.
        I even tried real SCRUM on one of my projects where I was a team lead.
        I like when I know exactly what needs to be done but it doesn't mean that I need direct instructions.
        I need to see a goal or at least a direction towards it.
        When a customer can't provide it to me I do all my best to help the customer to define it.
        Regardless of the processes, all my projects were done successfully, at least that what customers said.
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        I've been doing Test-Driven Development I think more than 10 years already.
        I do it in all the languages I've mentioned.
        After years of struggling and experience in the area, I'm sure that I know how to do it properly so it doesn't impede development but speeds it up instead.
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        I'm a clean coder or at least trying to be it.
        I believe that "the only way to go fast is to go well".
        Every time leaving less mess than found.
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        Software development is not only writing code.
        It is also an integration with other components, tools, libraries or frameworks, and even other applications.
        I know how to deal with source version control systems like subversion, git, mercurial.
        I've participated in the improvement and development of build systems for projects I've worked on.
        Over recent years I've gained experience in Continuous Integration, Continuous Deployment, and Delivery.
        I even developed the CI/CD system for microservices applications almost from scratch.
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        Talking about integration between software components we'll face a dependency management problem.
        This is one of the hard problems in software but I have knowledge and experience how to overcome it and build maintainable, and testable systems based on interchangeable components.
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        And the very important aspect of software development in my standpoint is communication with colleagues, sharing ideas, and learning from each other.
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        I love sharing my ideas with a team and I feel need in this.
        We all stand on each otherâ€™s shoulders.
        And the relevance of other's experience can't be understated.
        When I get some new idea I first of all search for a person who disagrees with it.
        Because I know that we see this World differently and everyone's vision is an indefeasible part of a solution.
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        Every Friday I conduct two hours Cyber Dojo session where together with my teammates we solve common software problems using different programming languages and the Test-Driven Development approach.
        And I invite not only programmers to attend the sessions.

        I was a member of 'Toolsmiths' team that is responsible for developing and improvement of frameworks for testing of Unity3D platform.
        I took ownership over the run-time tests framework the most used framework for testing Unity on its API level.
        I've redesigned many component s of the framework using SOLID design principles and techniques of Clean Code.
        This effort has made the framework more robust and extendable. Those days we had >750 unique run-time API test cases.
        More than 10 000 test cases (across more than 20 platforms/players) are run in a single automated build verification test suite.
        And we easily execute more than 150 000 test cases per day.
        The tool for running the automation tests had a performance degradation while adding new tests.
        It intensively uses cross-process interaction with Unity Editor.
        I've analyzed the code in order to determine its computational complexity and to find redundant cross-process interactions.
        I've used code generation to create components which act on Editor's side and do all required actions at once rather than do each action by means of cross-process invocations.
        I've also found algorithm which has quadratic complexity and I've redesigned it.
        As a result time of running tests has been reduced in 30% percents.
        One of the big task was to build new bug reporting tool that every our customer uses.
        From the very beginning we developed the project using Test Driven Developing approach and put all the effort to keep design testable and maintainable.
        We have shipped the product much earlier than was planned and after first month of use we had only 10 minor and cosmetic bugs.
        I was involved in build infrastructure tasks and have mastered JamPlus.
        I even wrote the framework for unit testing in JamPlus.
        Part of my job is to teach and help other engineers to write tests and make the code testable.

        I've participated in variety of projects for iPhone, iPad, iPod and Android devices.
        The main product is a tool for managing cloud based storage.
        We were developed all product for both platforms iOS and Android.
        Despite of short period of my employment in the company I have mastered Objective-C, retain/release strategy, Core Data, Automatic Reference Counting, Grand Central Dispatch, Dispatch I/O, building UI by Story-boarding.
        And I have started to contribute into current projects by fixing existing issues and mentoring the rest of the team.
        I've participated in Android project as Team Lead. The project is a Point Of Sales kind of software.
        It utilizes Zero Configuration Network using jmDNS and 'Bonjour'-like services.
        I've designed and implemented fully operational prototype of Bump Screen printing subsystem utilizes Services (start and bind kind of services), communicating via sockets and using thread pools (executors) and asynchronous tasks.
        I also worked on pure Java project for <a href="http://kt.pearsonassessments.com">Pearson KT</a>.
        It uses socket communication, SSL, multi-threading via Java executor services.
        I've started from prototype using previous implementation and communication protocol specification as a reference.
        The client used iterative development process.
        Using TDD and techniques of clean code we always delivered user stories in time.

        The project is web application for AlloCine partners.
        It allows to maintain information about show times and other activities for cinemas.
        This is web application hosted on IIS which interacts with back-end databases through common services packed in separate .NET assemblies.
        SoftFluent CodeFluent Entities framework is used to access Database.
        I was working on back-end functionality as well as client side UI part.
        I found the way how to effectively utilize Linq2Sql to interact with entities generated by CodeFluent Entities.
        It allowed us to develop functionality faster, make code testable and use TDD approach.
        I have deeply studied the CodeFluent Entities framework so I was able to consult other team members on its usage.

        Client/Server architecture based system for Lifecycle Management of software for IBM iSeries, IBM AIX and Linux platforms.
        With client components for MS Windows platform, MS Visual Studio and eclipse IDEs.
        The software was build using three-tier architecture with custom middle-tier component.
        Persistence layer uses IBM DB2 for OS/400 and Linux.
        I took the position of team lead, but continued to design server-side components, as well as support for existing components and fixing bugs. And of course I continued to re-factor legacy code making it cleaner guided by the Boy Scouts rule.
        In the past six months, I informally took the position of SCRUM Master.
        I organized SCRUM process locally and effective communication with foreign SCRUM teams.
        Due to the growth of the project and neglecting the possible growth at the beginning, there was a problem with lack of space for export symbols in service programs (things like shared objects or DLL).
        I applied Dependency Inversion principle and implemented some sort of Inversion of Control container.
        It solved the problem, it also decoupled interrelated components and speeded up development on iSeries environment.
        On this project I personally seen the growth of our team.
        And it was really sad when the team was disbanded due to lack of projects.

        The software was build using three-tier architecture with custom middle-tier component.
        Persistence layer uses IBM DB2 for OS/400 and Linux.
        I participated in the development of all new components of the server-side part of the software.
        I supervised all stages of developing of these components.
        The project required maintenance of legacy code. A lot of legacy code was refactored by me personally.
        I introduced practice of unit testing.
        I've got a wealth of experience in the support and development of large enterprise-level software projects.
        We started with new functionality had to be integrated to the existing system.
        There was a constraint that we must avoid nested SQL queries.
        I devised a set of generic components for retrieving complex and interrelated objects from the database without their full materialization.
        This allowed to reduce nested SQL queries and use of STL algorithms for manipulation of these objects.
        This also increased overall performance.
        I have introduced a practice of unit testing on the product, which allowed to simplify refactoring of legacy areas.
        The build process on iSeries was taking much time.
        So, to alleviate and speed up the maintenance and refactoring I have wrote scripts for the make utility to incrementally build the system.

      <div class="paragraph">
        A clone of Facebook's Toolbar for Mozilla Firefox.
        The software consists of plug-in for IE and COM server which acts as mediator.
        The IE runs its tabs in different threads and the user can run several IE instances.
        So, there was a serious architectural decision on how to organize interaction between the toolbars residing on the tabs and allow them access to the shared state.
        We used separate out-process COM server which holds the state and interacts with Facebook's services.
        We also implemented the proxy classes to allow the tabs interact with the COM server smoothly without worry about multi-threading.
        It sounds arrogant, but the POC, design of the component and the first delivery was made completely by me.
        After this project Lohika used all the source code in other similar projects.

        The CAD Software for Civil Engineering.
        This Software built on AutoDesk's ObjectARX technology and uses AutoCAD engine.
        Designed to support whole process of structure modeling and drawings preparation.
        The main purpose of it is automatic preparation of drawings for models of steel constructions.
        Also it uses bi-directional integration (via COM) with calculation software for support of whole cycle of buildings design.
        I took position of Team Lead after long period of work on the project as software engineer.
        I developed core models of steel structure parts.
        I designed and implemented general mechanism for making 2D drawings from 3D construction model.
        I developed and implemented sophisticated algorithm and components for search similar solid elements in the model of steel structures.
        As my own initiative, I developed a template-based library to facilitate the development of ObjectARX applications.

        It was a green field project.
        On the first stages of the product we used Borland C++ Builder and VCL as a main platform.
        The ObjectARX library and our custom objects were build with Microsoft Visual C++ run-time library.
        I have implemented object API layer to use the ObjectARX stuff in application build with Borland C++ Builder and to host the application inside AutoCAD.
        On this project I have thoroughly studied the AutoCAD ObjectARX library and was a mentor in ObjectARX for the rest of the team.
        I've got wealth of experience in using AutoCAD as a tool for drawings.
        Developed set of product features.
        The project showed me that I have the ability to quickly learn frameworks.
