        I really love writing code, and I love do it not only for myself. It doesn't matter how big a task is. Despite of its size or complexity I do it with full dedication using best techniques I mastered over my career.
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        I started my software engineering jorney from C and C++.
        I felt in love with C++ and literaly was swallowing all related books I was able to get those days.
        My first C program was written in a piece of paper and when I got to a computer it didn't compile because it wasn't written in ANSI standard.
        But I moved forward...
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        These days I still love C++ and still know how to use it properly.
        But I also use C#, Java, Groovy, Kotlin, Python, Go. I know a bit of Rust and I'm interested in its deterministic resource management approach.
        I am able to write a good stuff using Lua, Perl, Shell or PowerShell scipting languages.
        Also I don't get attached to a specific paradigm and can use Object Oriented or Functional Programming or even mixed which I think strengthen the structure of a system maximizing its flexibility, maintainability, testability and robustness.
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        Apart of experience in programing languages, I have years of experience with different application arhitectures, starting from small tools with a command line interface or desktop GUI, including fancy mobile or Web apps, up to complex multi-component cloud based distributed applications.
        The aplications were developed for a wide range of industries such as civil engineering, application development its quality and life cycle management, communication, education, finance, game development.
        The systems I've developed run on PC's controlled by Windows, Linux, MacOS, mobile devices running Android or iOS, game consoles and mainframes.
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        During my career, I've experienced a range of software development processes, some of them more classic and a bit chaotic, some of them were almost agile.
        I even tried real SCRUM on one of my projects where I was a team lead.
        I like when I know exactly what needs to be done but it doesn't mean that I need direct instructions.
        I need to see a goal or at least a direction towards it. When a customer can't provide it to me I do all my best to help the customer to define it.
        Regardless of the processes all my projects were done successfully, at least that what customers said.
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        I've been doing Test Driven Development I think more than 10 years already.
        I do it in all the languages I've mentioned.
        After years of struggling and experience in the area I'm sure that I know how to do it properly so it doesn't impede development but speeds it up instead.
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        I'm a clean coder or at least trying to be it.
        I believe that "the only way to go fast is to go well".
        Each time leaving less mess than found.
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        The software development is not only a writing code.
        It is also integration with other components, tools, libraries or frameworks and even other applications.
        I know how to deal with source version control systems like subversion, git, mercurial.
        I've participated in improvement and development of build systems for projects I've worked on.
        Over recent years I've gained experience in Continuous Integration, Continuous Deployment and Delivery.
        I even developed the CI/CD system for microservices applications almost from scratch.
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        Talking about integration between software components we'll face a dependency management problem.
        This is one of the hard problems in a software but I have knowledge and experience how to overcome it and build maintainable, and testable systems based on interchangable components.
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        And the very important aspect of software development in my standpoint is a communication with colleagues, sharing ideas and learning from each other.
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        I love share my ideas with a team and I feel need in this.
        We all stand on each otherâ€™s shoulders. And relevance of others experience can't be understated.
        When I got some new idea I first search for a person who disagree with it.
        Because I know that we see this World differently and everyone's vision is an indefeasible part of a solution.
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        Each friday I conduct two hours Cyber Dojo session where together with my team mates we solve common software problems using different programming languages and Test Driven Development approach.
        And I invite not only programmers to attend the sessions.

        I was a member of 'Toolsmiths' team that is responsible for developing and improvement of frameworks for testing of Unity3D platform.
        I took ownership over the run-time tests framework the most used framework for testing Unity on its API level.
        I've redesigned many component s of the framework using SOLID design principles and techniques of Clean Code.
        This effort has made the framework more robust and extendable. Those days we had >750 unique run-time API test cases.
        More than 10 000 test cases (across more than 20 platforms/players) are run in a single automated build verification test suite.
        And we easily execute more than 150 000 test cases per day.
        The tool for running the automation tests had a performance degradation while adding new tests.
        It intensively uses cross-process interaction with Unity Editor.
        I've analyzed the code in order to determine its computational complexity and to find redundant cross-process interactions.
        I've used code generation to create components which act on Editor's side and do all required actions at once rather than do each action by means of cross-process invocations.
        I've also found algorithm which has quadratic complexity and I've redesigned it.
        As a result time of running tests has been reduced in 30% percents.
        One of the big task was to build new bug reporting tool that every our customer uses.
        From the very beginning we developed the project using Test Driven Developing approach and put all the effort to keep design testable and maintainable.
        We have shipped the product much earlier than was planned and after first month of use we had only 10 minor and cosmetic bugs.
        I was involved in build infrastructure tasks and have mastered JamPlus.
        I even wrote the framework for unit testing in JamPlus.
        Part of my job is to teach and help other engineers to write tests and make the code testable.
